We are following the 80/20 rule in the below plan

## DATA BOUNTY APP

---

1. Data bounty backend that receives the api call to create the data bounty

- Python backend. No integration between React front and python backend, pure HTTP comms.
- Dockerfile for backend

1. Data bounty front-end. Most important requirements:

- **Log-in / sign up panel**. We need to let EVERYONE use this platform. This means make this website usable even for people who do not have metamask / hardware wallet. [I will explain this in more detail]
- **Create data bounty modal / page**. What meta goes here? Some that I can think of:

  - expiration
  - Types: a few (see extras). but to begin with: no approval required, anyone can start working on the bounty
  - price in OCEAN
  - Description of the bounty
  - creator of the bounty
  - date created

- **Data bounty page**. After Alice creates bounty this is its page
  bounty
- **Panel to search for bounties**. Do you think something similar to Gitcoin would be OK?

- **Sample data submission workflow**. I think that we would have a button on the data bounty page that allows Bob, Charlie and other freelancers to submit the sample of their dataset. No need for any meta other than the time when this was submitted, the id of the submitter, anything else? This will go into the db too. (sidenote on the db: looks like we don't need much relationships here, so it is better to go for non-relational db that would scale well in the future, e.g. MongoDB)

### **EXTRAS: Pick the most important ones from below if we have time to do more**

Listed in the order of importance: top - most important

- Only the buyers of the dataset have the option to review the full dataset, and only after some while.
- More data bounty types:
  - A lot of people apply, you select one to work
  - Co-operative - everyone works on the single task. People express the interest in bounty, and then all get to work on the same task
  - Contest. Many teams work, you select one / multiple winners
  - linter for data
  - User Profile page
  - Help (tip and tricks, faq etc...)
  - [TheGraph, I think is is like GraphQL](https://thegraph.com/)
  - pre-commit
  - decide which db to use for this. non-relational scale well, but are not great for relational data, like what we have. This means that we will have to cleverly partition the data in the future to scale this part
  - Kubernetes
  - pagination of bounties
  - text descriptions of bounties, in the future: md with mathjax to support equations (useful for data scientists)
  - validation for user, bounties, etc., wherever we have put / post requests
  - add HEAD endpoint
  - edit user endpoint

---

## Application routes map

- Welcome page (application overview (Log-in/sign up modal))
- All bounties (with filters panel)
- Bounty view page
- Bounty create page
- Bounty edit page

---

## Application backend (Python Falcon)

We will use docker-compose to glue the pieces together

#### PUT /api/user <- IMPLEMENTED

will create a user. This method should be called when the user clicks "Log In" on the front end. If is their first time logging in, modal opens up enabling them to
fill out the information below (the things in the square brackets are optional)

`[...]` <- means optional

```json
{
  "addr": "valid ethereum address",
  ["aboutMe": "I am this and that"],
  ["name": "my first name"],
  ["lastName": "..."],
  ["nickname": "dsfsdf"],
  ["dateOfBirth": "sdfdsfds"],
}
```

if they fill it out correctly, we let them in, and no errors are shown, ideally,
we validate this on the front end, for now let's skip the validations, i will add them to extra steps

response is code `200` with no body

#### PUT /api/user/<user_id> <- IMPLEMENTED

#### PUT /api/bounty <- IMPLEMENTED

```json
{
  "title": "djfksajfklsj",
  "issuer": string ethAddr,
  "price": 200.01 float,
  "expiry": unix int,
  "type": enum string,
  "description": "sdasda",
  "shortDescription": "blah blah",
  "complexity": enum string -> {"Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced" },
  "tags": enum string for now (i.e. pre-defined tags),
  "completed": bool enum "true/false"
  ("id": "989kkdkkd") <- auto generated. will be a uuid string
}
```

?anything else

^ if `bountyId` is specified in the above, then that is the edit call. Disable the edit button on the front for non-funders

#### PUT /api/bounty/<bounty_id> <- IMPLEMENTED

edits the bounty

#### DELETE /api/bounty/<bounty_id> <- IMPLEMENTED

#### GET /api/bounty[?createdAfter=18289911&tags='python,go,stocks,medical'&by='ivdima,nazariyv']

for now will not paginate. But in the future it will

**Response Format**

```json
[
  {
    "title": "djfksajfklsj",
    "issuer": string ethAddr,
    "price": 200.01 float,
    "expiry": unix int,
    "type": enum string,
    "description": "sdasda",
    "shortDescription": "blah blah",
    "complexity": enum string -> {"Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced" },
    "tags": enum string for now (i.e. pre-defined tags),
    "completed": bool enum "true/false",

    "created": unixTimestamp,
    "numApplicants": int,
    "numSubmissions": int,
    "numSampleSubmissions": int,
    "bountyState": string enum,

    "sampleSubmissions": [uint, uint, ...], <- ids
    "submissions": [uint, uint, ...], <- ids
  },
  {
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

#### PUT /api/bounty/<bounty_id>/submit_sample

#### PUT /api/bounty/<bounty_id>/submit_sample/<sample_id>

#### PUT /api/bounty/<bounty_id>/submit

### Web server (React) helper endpoints

#### GET /api/web/complexityOptions <- IMPLEMENTED

**Response**

```json
["Intermediate", "Beginner", "Advanced"]
```

#### GET /api/web/tags <- IMPLEMENTED

**Response**

```json
["react", "stocks", "crypto", "python", ...]
```

## DB Schemas

*TODO more schemes to follow (TODO: look at ranking etc. requirements on there)

**User**
- ethereum address (acts as primary key)
- date joined
- ["aboutMe": "I am this and that"]
- ["name": "my first name"],
- ["lastName": "..."],
- ["nickname": "dsfsdf"],
- ["dateOfBirth": "sdfdsfds"],

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/334183/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-store-tags-in-a-database -->
**Tags**
- tag_id | tag_title


**Bounty_tags**
- bounty_id | tag_id

**User_bounty**
- addr | bounty_id

**User_submissions**
- addr | submission_id

**Submission**
- (id primary key) <- uuid autogenerated
- created unix int timestamp
- data url ipfs hash
[more later on]
