We are following the 80/20 rule in the below plan

## DATA BOUNTY APP

---

1. Data bounty backend that receives the api call to create the data bounty

- Python backend. No integration between React front and python backend, pure HTTP comms.
- Dockerfile for backend

1. Data bounty front-end. Most important requirements:

- **Log-in / sign up panel**. We need to let EVERYONE use this platform. This means make this website usable even for people who do not have metamask / hardware wallet. [I will explain this in more detail]
- **Create data bounty modal / page**. What meta goes here? Some that I can think of:
    - expiration
    - Types: a few (see extras). but to begin with: no approval required, anyone can start working on the bounty
    - price in OCEAN
    - Description of the bounty
    - creator of the bounty
    - date  created

- **Data bounty page**. After Alice creates bounty this is its page
bounty
- **Panel to search for bounties**. Do you think something similar to Gitcoin would be OK?

- **Sample data submission workflow**. I think that we would have a button on the data bounty page that allows Bob, Charlie and other freelancers to submit the sample of their dataset. No need for any meta other than the time when this was submitted, the id of the submitter, anything else? This will go into the db too. (sidenote on the db: looks like we don't need much relationships here, so it is better to go for non-relational db that would scale well in the future, e.g. MongoDB)

### **EXTRAS: Pick the most important ones from below if we have time to do more**

Listed in the order of importance: top - most important

- Only the buyers of the dataset have the option to review the full dataset, and only after some while.
- More data bounty types:
  - A lot of people apply, you select one to work
  - Co-operative - everyone works on the single task. People express the interest in bounty, and then all get to work on the same task
  - Contest. Many teams work, you select one / multiple winners
  - linter for data
