We are following the 80/20 rule in the below plan

## DATA BOUNTY APP

---

1. Data bounty backend that receives the api call to create the data bounty

- Python backend. No integration between React front and python backend, pure HTTP comms.
- Dockerfile for backend

1. Data bounty front-end. Most important requirements:

- **Log-in / sign up panel**. We need to let EVERYONE use this platform. This means make this website usable even for people who do not have metamask / hardware wallet. [I will explain this in more detail]
- **Create data bounty modal / page**. What meta goes here? Some that I can think of:

  - expiration
  - Types: a few (see extras). but to begin with: no approval required, anyone can start working on the bounty
  - price in OCEAN
  - Description of the bounty
  - creator of the bounty
  - date created

- **Data bounty page**. After Alice creates bounty this is its page
  bounty
- **Panel to search for bounties**. Do you think something similar to Gitcoin would be OK?

- **Sample data submission workflow**. I think that we would have a button on the data bounty page that allows Bob, Charlie and other freelancers to submit the sample of their dataset. No need for any meta other than the time when this was submitted, the id of the submitter, anything else? This will go into the db too. (sidenote on the db: looks like we don't need much relationships here, so it is better to go for non-relational db that would scale well in the future, e.g. MongoDB)

### **EXTRAS: Pick the most important ones from below if we have time to do more**

Listed in the order of importance: top - most important

- Only the buyers of the dataset have the option to review the full dataset, and only after some while.
- More data bounty types:
  - A lot of people apply, you select one to work
  - Co-operative - everyone works on the single task. People express the interest in bounty, and then all get to work on the same task
  - Contest. Many teams work, you select one / multiple winners
  - linter for data
  - User Profile page
  - Help (tip and tricks, faq etc...)
  - [TheGraph, I think is is like GraphQL](https://thegraph.com/)
  - pre-commit
  - decide which db to use for this. non-relational scale well, but are not great for relational data, like what we have. This means that we will have to cleverly partition the data in the future to scale this part
  - Kubernetes
  - pagination of bounties
  - text descriptions of bounties, in the future: md with mathjax to support equations (useful for data scientists)

---

## Application routes map

- Welcome page (application overview (Log-in/sign up modal))
- All bounties (with filters panel)
- Bounty view page
- Bounty create page
- Bounty edit page

---

## Application backend (Python Falcon)

We will use docker-compose to glue the pieces together

#### POST /api/authenticate

Call to authenticate the user (?Dima: user presses login -> (a) they do not have an ethereum address(b) they have ethereum address

(a) check this in React, if does not have, then prompt them to create one

(b) we send a call to authenticate with their ethereum address, containing the following:

**Request Format**

```json
{
  userEthAddr: "0xaa2212999b2321"
}
```

? anything else (timestamp and unique id i'll make on the backend)

**Response Format**

```json
{
  userId: "base64encodedstring",
}
```

^ that string is stored in redis cache, and it maps the `userId` to the ethereum address, which is a primary key in our user table

whenever the user makes a subsequent request, we check that this id has not expired yet, if it has, we send back the `401` http code that means that the re-authentication is required. They re-login, and we send them back a new `userId`.

#### GET /api/bounties[?createdAfter=18289911&tags='python,go,stocks,medical'&by='ivdima,nazariyv']

for now will not paginate. But in the future it will

**Response Format**

```json
[
  {
    title: "sdsadas",
    issuer: string ethAddr, <- заказчик
    price: 200.01 float,
    expiry: unix int,
    type: enum string,
    id: "989kkdkkd",
    complexity: like below in /api/bounty
    tags: also like below,

    created: unixTimestamp,
    numApplicants: int,
    numSubmissions: int,
    numSampleSubmissions: int,
    bountyState: string enum,

    sampleSubmissions: [uint, uint, ...], <- ids
    submissions: [uint, uint, ...], <- ids
  },
  {

  },
  ...
]
```

#### PUT /api/bounty

need db for this. let's use mySQL for now, it's a hack

```json
{
  title: "djfksajfklsj",
  issuer: string ethAddr,
  price: 200.01 float,
  expiry: unix int,
  type: enum string,
  description: "sdasda",
  complexity: enum string -> {"Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced" },
  tags: enum string for now (i.e. pre-defined tags),
  [id: "989kkdkkd"]
}
```

?anything else

^ if `bountyId` is specified in the above, then that is the edit call. Disable the edit button on the front for non-funders

#### PUT /api/bounty:id/submitSample[:id]

#### PUT /api/bounty:id/submit

### Web server (React) helper endpoints

#### GET /api/web/complexityOptions

**Response**

```json
["Intermediate", "Beginner", "Advanced"]
```

#### GET /api/web/tags

**Response**

```json
["react", "stocks", "crypto", "python", ...]
```

### DB Schemas

*TODO more schemes to follow

- User
- unique_id primary key (generate on the fly for now. 5 char base64 encoded string gives 1 billion combos and will only take 0.1 MB space)
- ethereum address
- date first joined

### All together

I will make a pretty drawing here later

db (haven't decided yet if to go with sql or no-sql)
