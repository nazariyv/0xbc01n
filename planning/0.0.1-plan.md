We are following the 80/20 rule in the below plan

## DATA BOUNTY APP

---

1. Data bounty backend that receives the api call to create the data bounty

- Python backend with [Swagger API](https://swagger.io/blog/api-development/automatically-generating-swagger-specifications-wi/). No integration between React front and python backend, pure HTTP comms.
- Dockerfile for backend

2. Data bounty front-end. Most important requirements:

- **Log-in / sign up panel**. We need to let EVERYONE use this platform. This means make this website usable even for people who do not have metamask / hardware wallet. [I will explain this in more detail]
- **Create data bounty**. What meta goes here? Some that I can think of:
   - expiration
   - Types: a few (see extras). but to begin with: no approval required, anyone can start working on the bounty
   - price in OCEAN
   - Description of the bounty
   - creator of the bounty
   - date bounty created

- Panel to search for bounties, do you think something similar to Gitcoin would be OK?

### **EXTRAS: Pick the most important ones from below if we have time to do more**

Listed in the order of importance: top - most important

- Only the buyers of the dataset have the option to review the full dataset, and only after some while. 
- More data bounty types:
  - A lot of people apply, you select one to work
  - Co-operative - everyone works on the single task. People express the interest in bounty, and then all get to work on the same task
  - Contest. Many teams work, you select one / multiple winners
